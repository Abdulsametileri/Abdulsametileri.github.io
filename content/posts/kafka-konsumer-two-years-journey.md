Last year, we introduced [kafka-konsumer](https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/kafka-konsumer-c47b4b8c1599) and
[kafka-cronsumer](https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/kafka-exception-c-r-onsumer-37c459e4849d) libraries in their
articles. After one year of development,
we are thrilled to write a new blog post introducing other useful features and our use cases. During those two years of
journey, these two libraries have been used in **100+ projects** in Trendyol. ðŸš€

First of all, letâ€™s remember what these libraries are. Basically,

- [Kafka Konsumer](https://github.com/Trendyol/kafka-konsumer): ensures the easy implementation of Kafka consumer with a
built-in exception manager (Kafka-cronsumer).
- [Kafka Cronsumer](https://github.com/Trendyol/kafka-cronsumer): cron-based Kafka exception consumer with the power of
auto retry & concurrency
